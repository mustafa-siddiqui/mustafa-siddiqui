I am an embedded software engineer @ [Lutron Electronics](https://www.lutron.com/en-US/pages/default.aspx), based in Philly, PA. I recently graduated cum laude, with high distinction, from the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu/) (class of '22 🙌) with a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering. During my undergrad, I fell in love with software and the intersection of it with hardware -- which led me to pursue the field of embedded systems. With a deep love of solving problems and building stuff, I hope to contribute to the world in a meaningful way.

While I am not working, I love to explore new places, hang out with friends, and read - fiction & poetry. I also love to play soccer & chess.
