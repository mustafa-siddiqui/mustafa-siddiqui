### Hi, I'm Mustafa 👋🏼

![headerImage](https://github.com/mustafa-siddiqui/mustafa-siddiqui/blob/master/headerImage.png)

I am currently a sophomore international student at the University of Rochester. I am pursuing my undergraduate degree in electrical and computer engineering. While I am not working, I I love to explore new places, be fascinated by architectural wonders, read - fiction and poetry - and write occasionally; words hold an extraordinary power in my eyes. I love to play soccer and chess.
